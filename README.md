## Profile

Final-year Computer Engineering student with a strong interest in cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and computer vision.

I am particularly motivated by understanding how systems operate internally — from low-level programming concepts to scalable backend architectures. My goal is to build solid engineering foundations that allow me to design robust and efficient systems in the future.

I have experience supporting IT operations and infrastructure coordination within a technology-driven company, which strengthened my understanding of real-world technical environments and operational workflows.
